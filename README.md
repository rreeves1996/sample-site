## Comments

This was as far as I got in a few hours - I wasn't sure if it was more important that I got things done accurately/as pretty as possible, or as time-effecient as possible, so I tried to strike a balance. If I had extra time, many things would've been done differently and cleaner; however, since my time was being measured, I tried not to get too stuck on the details.
